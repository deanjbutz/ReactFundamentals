                <dd>By passing props, Functional Components are capable of both rendering state variables for display, as well as updating the value of state variable(s). We'll take a deeper dive into state and props later on = so don't fret if that doesn't make sense right now.</dd>
                <dt>No <i>this</i> keyword</dt>
                <dd>Class Components (or stateful components) in React will always requires the use of the <i>this</i> keyword when initializing an object using the constructor method. Functional Components (or display components), however, are instanceless - meaning they have no access to the <i>this</i> keyword.</dd>
                <dt><i>return()</i></dt>
                <dd>Functional Components (as well as Class Components) must return a single element - but the single element returned from the function may have children elements nested inside of it.</dd>
